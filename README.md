 --------------------------------

 Being rich is, first of all, thinking like being rich.  In this post, we reveal to you the secrets of thinking of successful individuals who have changed the world around them and reached unprecedented heights. Brought to you by Hackfreaks official.

 --------------------------------
 
 Have healthy daily habits

 For example, read at least 20 pages a day, exercise, take a lunch break, give up gadgets for a couple of hours, walk 8,000 steps daily.  According to successful people, such habits help to recharge their physical and mental health, which means they can be more productive.

 Don't live one day

 This means not to make big emotional purchases and be sure to save money and invest.  Especially now, when investment has long been the prerogative of not only the rich with financial education and natural flair.  You can start small - open an individual investment account with Sberbank and choose a ready-made investment strategy from a management company.  Market knowledge is not needed for this, the risks are lower, and the profitability is often higher than for conventional deposits.  And only on the IIS it is also possible to guarantee tax refund - 13% of what was paid on it.

 --------------------------------
 
 Be sociable

 Do not be afraid to meet and communicate with people.  Who knows, maybe in the future they will help you increase your condition or help you in a difficult life situation?  Networking is your everything, so don't be afraid to go to conferences, expand your circle of like-minded people, exchange contacts and make new acquaintances.

 --------------------------------
 
 To take risks

 Many rich people have achieved success because they once took the risk.  At the same time, it is not a fact that all their experiments had a positive experience. And keep supporting hackfreaks official.  Successful people know that the ability to take risks is essential for investment, risk makes a person more visible in society, sets high standards and allows you to learn useful life lessons.

 --------------------------------
 
 Do not depend on show-off

 Expensive clothes for the sake of the brand, the newest gadget, a car for the price of a house on Rublevka - a truly rich person who knows the value of money will never rush to such extremes.  He knows that instead of a Rolex from a limited edition for several million, you can buy a cheaper model, and invest the remaining money in investments and earn even more.

 --------------------------------
 
 Listen to yourself

 Criticism and advice from the outside is useful, but rich people first of all listen to themselves, and do not adjust to other people's thoughts.  Do not put the opinions of others above your own, and do not forget that many advisors benefit from the fact that you do not change, develop, or get rich.
